# Text Classification with RoBERTa and NLTK 

This project leverages **RoBERTa** and **NLTK** to perform text classification on a large 500k-row dataset. The goal is to build a model capable of understanding and classifying text efficiently using advanced techniques such as dynamic masking, sentence packing, and byte-level BPE vocabulary.

## Key Features

### RoBERTa for Advanced Context Understanding:
- **Dynamic Masking**: Randomly masks tokens during training to improve generalization and prevent overfitting by exposing the model to varied training contexts at each epoch.
- **Sentence Packing**: Combines multiple sentences into a single input sequence to maximize the 512-token input limit, making it suitable for handling longer documents.
- **Larger Batches**: Optimizes training speed and stability by using larger batch sizes for processing multiple samples at once.
- **Byte-level BPE Vocabulary**: Utilizes byte pair encoding (BPE) to tokenize text at the byte level, ensuring robust handling of diverse text, including special characters and misspellings.

### NLTK for Preprocessing and Sentiment Analysis:
- **Preprocessing**: Uses NLTK tools to clean and prepare the text for classification, including tokenization and part-of-speech tagging.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Implements sentiment analysis using NLTKâ€™s **VADER** lexicon, allowing the model to gauge the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the text.

## How It Works

1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - The raw text is first preprocessed using NLTK's **punkt tokenizer**, **averaged perceptron tagger** for part-of-speech tagging, and **maxent_ne_chunker** for named entity recognition.
   - Sentiment analysis is performed using NLTKâ€™s **VADER lexicon** to evaluate the sentiment of text.

2. **Model Training**:
   - RoBERTa is fine-tuned on the preprocessed text dataset using dynamic masking and sentence packing to improve contextual understanding.
   - The model is trained with larger batch sizes to ensure efficient learning and to handle large datasets effectively.

3. **Classification**:
   - Once trained, the model can classify text based on its content, leveraging the contextual power of RoBERTa and the preprocessing capabilities of NLTK.

##  Results
- The model achieves **high accuracy** in classifying text across multiple categories, demonstrating strong performance on a large, real-world dataset.
- The combination of **dynamic masking, sentence packing, and byte-level BPE vocabulary** significantly enhances the modelâ€™s ability to understand and process complex text patterns, improving classification results.
